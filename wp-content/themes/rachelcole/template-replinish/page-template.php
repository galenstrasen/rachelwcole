                           <p>What if this year, you could discover how life — your whole, precious, every-day-is-different life — can feed you deeply?</p>
<p>What if this year, you could <em>FEAST</em> on your life?</p>
<p>Now you can. I invite you to come along with me.</p>
<h3 class="big-h"><em>FEAST</em> is an intensive 3-month masterclass&nbsp;for women who want to come home to themselves, make peace with food, and feast on their lives.</h3>
<p>We’re going on a 12-week guided journey from late August&nbsp;to November&nbsp;2017. A few dozen&nbsp;women will gather together with me from all corners of the world to connect, to share, to encourage, to uplift, to nurture, to heal, and to grow. We will meet online and you will work in your own time and space.</p>
<p>It’s a radical act for a woman to choose a life of feast, rather than a life of famine.</p>

<div class="well ta-left">
<ul>
<li>a supportive community of like-hearted women to journey with you</li>
<li>lessons based on years of study and research as well as my role as teacher and mentor to hundreds of women</li>
<li>opportunities to self-reﬂect and assess where you’re at, in writing and in spoken conversation</li>
<li>clear, practical tools and the guidance to put them in motion</li>
<li>a safe space that will allow you more ease and grace in your life for your own hungers to show up and be seen, heard, and fed</li>

                    <h3 class="sol section-last-line" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">I see you.</h3>
<p>You are whip smart brilliant. And your bookshelf is overflowing with “self-help” books you’ve read (and several you haven’t) – all of which you thought would change your life.</p>
<p>You believe in a sacred life force. You swim in the deep end.</p>
<p>You know everything is connected and the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>You could practically be a nutritionist yourself with all of the knowledge you’ve absorbed through the years.</p>
<p>Intellectually, you ‘get’ why diets don’t work.</p>
<p>The thing is, all this knowing hasn’t made you feel at ease around food, at home in your body, or open-hearted with yourself. And this recognition is hard to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Food feels hard. Self-compassion feels hard. Riding (yet again) the pendulum of restriction to over-consumption and back again feels even worse.</p>
<p>You are on the cusp of a ceasefire with yourself.</p>
<p>And so …</p>
<p>I see you. You are ready. Unwilling to wait another year. Chasing weight loss, exhausted by your inner critic, hungry and distracted by your cravings. You have promised yourself that this will not be your story going forward.</p>
<p>It’s time to lay it all down.</p>
<p>It’s time to step off the tightrope and choose the easeful path.</p>
<p>Feast is the better way.</p>

<p>I created <em>Feast</em> because it’s possible to live a life that feels kind, nourishing, and easeful.</p>
<p>I created <em>Feast</em> to teach women how to feed themselves – at the table, and away from it.</p>
<p>I’m taking over a decade of professional, academic, and deep personal exploration in living a well-fed life and making it available to you wherever you live.</p>

<div class="well ta-left sol">
<ul>
<li><strong>I’ve earned</strong> my Life Coaching certiﬁcation from the renowned Coaches Training Institute (CTI) and a Masters degree in Holistic Health Education from<br>
John F. Kennedy University.</li>
<li><strong>I’ve hosted</strong> transformative retreats across the United States and internationally to sold-out gatherings of women on how they too can ﬁnd ease and fulﬁllment in their lives simply by honoring their own hungers.</li>
<li><strong>I’m truly fortunate</strong> I beat my eating disorder and I’m way wiser, so much deeper, and insanely more compassionate for it.</li>
<li><strong>I feel</strong> both energized and deeply at peace when facilitating other women’s awakening to their own deep hungers. This is what I’m here to do this lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>I’ve lead</strong> the Feast journey five times (this will be the sixth) and it remains the most impactful endeavor of work.</li>

<p><em>Accepted applicants who apply <strong>on or before</strong>&nbsp;the early bird deadline (July 30th)&nbsp;can choose between paying one-time in full $1500 or in three monthly-installments of $550.</em> <em>Applicants accepted during this initial time period will also receive a complimentary 45-minute one-on-one session with Rachel to be used anytime during the duration of the course.</em></p>
<p><em>Accepted applicants who apply <strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the early bird deadline (July 31st or later) can choose between paying one-time in full $2000 or in four&nbsp;monthly-installments of $550.</em></p>
<p>The monetary cost of <em>Feast</em> represents the significant value engaged participants will receive. Participants will benefit from years of my hard-won personal experience and professional training, my study and curation of the most excellent and deeply helpful resources available on the topic, plus my experience in facilitating hundreds of women of all ages, sizes, and walks of life through the tender territory of feeding one’s true hungers.</p>
<p>But perhaps most importantly, your investment in <em>Feast</em> is an external commitment to the inner transformation you are stepping into. Into this program, I have put&nbsp;the very best teaching, trainings, experiential and empathic insights I have around helping women break free once and for all. And I am bringing together a marvelously wise and insightful group of women to come alongside you on your inner journey.</p>
<p>If the Feast group program is out of your financial reach you may be interested in the self-guided option. For full details on this limited time offer, <a style="color: #ef7061 !important; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://feast.rachelwcole.com/selfguided/"><em>click here</em></a>.</p>

my intentions in creating this program:</h3>
<div class="ta-left">
<p><span class="sol">FIRST,</span> <em>Feast</em> is NOT a diet program nor is it intended to help women lose weight. Therefore, if you are hoping to or counting on losing weight with this program, this is not the program for you. <em>Feast</em> is about coming home to ourselves, our bodies, and our hungers. <em>Feast</em> celebrates the broad diversity of body sizes in the world and acknowledges that health exists across the body size-spectrum. The long-term outcome of the provided practices is often a return to one’s set-point weight. For some this will be higher than their current weight and for others it will be lower and for some it will result in no change at all. Regardless, weight change is not a goal of <em>Feast</em>, rather this course is for women who have begun to understand that their happiness and wellbeing is not dependent on a number on the scale.</p>
<p><span class="sol">SECOND,</span> <em>Feast</em> is designed for women who are prepared to make space in their lives to fully participate in the program. It will be an intensive three months, designed with the feel of spaciousness and plenty of integration time. The limited spaces in this program are meant for women who are ready now… those who are willing, and able to create time in their schedule to dedicate to doing the work and connecting with others on the same path.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s a radical act for a woman to choose a life of feast, rather than a life of famine.</p>
<h4 class="section-last-line" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: -10px;">Is now the&nbsp;time&nbsp;you make this choice?</h4>

Leaning into the teachings of this course freed me by prying my mind (and mouth!) open to all the food this world has to offer after years of deprivation. I was amazed each week at what a monumental difference small changes like being kind toward myself, pausing for reflection before acting, taking a walk, or having a slice of toast had on my overall stability, life satisfaction, and sense of well-being. I cannot speak highly enough of Rachel as a teacher, guide and facilitator, and <i>Feast</i> as the first step in a new life direction. Filling out the course application was one of the scariest and bravest things I've ever done and I'm so thankful to that little voice inside myself that knew the time was right for me--and I was worth it. I hope the time is right for you to listen also.</p>

If I wasn't judging what I was currently eating as good or bad, I was planning my next highly restrictive diet or reading some new book on food. I was unhappy with my body, as it always felt like a project that needed fixing. I was desperate to move past this obsession, but I thought the way was through "fixing" my body once and for all. I didn't realize the problem wasn't my body, but my mind. Feast taught me the skills I needed to love and respect myself, which have brought me more peace than I thought possible. I am a different person, a more loving, aware, and powerful person, all because of Feast. I can't recommend it enough.</p>
<p>Ultimately, unhappiness with food and my body is what led me to Feast, and I'm eternally thankful. Feast has not just changed the way I feel about my body, but about my life, and what I'm capable of. Every woman should learn these skills. If you're thinking about it, do it. Do it. Do it.</p>

Peace from feeling like I wasn’t enough, peace from self-loathing that comes from endless cycles of dieting and inevitable weight gain. Although those cycles quieted my inner wisdom to barely a whisper, there was still something inside me that desperately believed there must be a better way. <i>Feast</i> is that better way. Through Rachel Cole’s <i>Feast</i>, I learned how to turn up the volume on my inner wisdom. I went from beating myself up to being kind and compassionate.  Most importantly, I was reminded that I didn’t have to earn my worth. I was and am always enough. <i>Feast</i> has changed me. I could not be more grateful for having the opportunity to take part in this life-changing 12 weeks. </p>

Because I had to "apply" I put a lot of thought into what I wanted from the program and knew the only way it would be effective for me was if I made the commitment to actively participate and stay engaged.  Every week I checked in with myself to see if I was getting what I wanted based on my original answers in the application.  If something was missing I had to take responsibility to find out why and what I needed to do differently.  I participated in <i>Feast</i> during a major transition in my life - the acceptance and support I received from Rachel and all the other members of the group was heartwarming and I will never forget this 12 weeks in my life.  I truly felt connected to the group and trusted them to accept me no matter what thoughts or feelings I shared.</p>

I no longer need to seek outside advice; the expert to my well-being lies within me. The bottom line for me is that no amount of weight I ever lost on any diet over the years left me feeling as excited about my life as I do now after completing <i>Feast</i>.</p>

Such comforting words, as if Rachel took the idea behind "comfort food" and fleshed it out into a curriculum or syllabus, to help women fulfill our needs for all the essential food AND non-food hungers. It is a collaborative environment where sharing our journeys is both welcomed and supported, where all woman are both welcomed and supported. I had no idea in how many ways it would enrich my life to give myself permission to indulge in such a fantastic act of self-care.

It was the process of actually doing <i>Feast</i> that made possible the kind of perceptual shift that my reading a ton of self-help books on my own had not. As a result I am less preoccupied with food, more appreciative of my body, and kinder to myself and others. My partner commented that I have more energy now and seem less anxious. I'm certainly open to experiencing joy in life in a whole new way - I'm so glad that I gave myself the gift of <i>Feast</i>.</p>

                    <p><i>Feast</i> is a carefully and lovingly constructed experience that allowed me to see my own truth more clearly. Rachel gently and expertly guided us through the steps necessary to create the foundation for a well-fed life. Not only do I feel a renewed sense of peace around food and my body, I have realized my own power to make choices and changes in my life, to have what I'm truly hungry for. </p>

                    <p>With <i>Feast</i>, Rachel has masterfully woven together a progressive course that builds day to day--especially through the honest, digestible lessons on Monday, thoughtful reflection questions on Tuesday, realistic challenges on Wednesday--and week to week, starting a foundation of self-care that was both more practical and more powerful than I have found in other courses. </p>
<p>The key ingredient, though, is Rachel herself. She has a wonderful ability to take, with genuine love and exquisite grace, what felt like a mix of jumbled thoughts I expressed and quickly distill the areas of challenges and offer gentle, practical options for shifting my thinking and my practices. When I started <i>Feast</i>, I worried a bit about "feasting" on life; it sounded tantalizing, but also a bit intense. I worried it would just feel like too much. </p>
<p>Through <i>Feast</i>, I found ways to dive in and embrace myself and my needs, sensitivities, and hungers and I also found the importance and pleasure that can come, with food and in the rest of my life, from choosing to nibble and from the freedom to say "I've had enough" and "I don't want this." Because of that, I came away from <i>Feast</i> feeling satisfied and not overstuffed.</p>

                    <p>I don't know how to put it into words exactly.  I struggle with describing how anything has really changed because on the surface things look the same.  But underneath the changes have been profound and significant.  </p>
<p>I think <i>Feast</i> should be a required for every woman.  Laying a foundation of self compassion is life changing.  From that basis, life feels more full of possibility.  Life feels more full of magic.  Knowing you can reach and try and grow and sometimes succeed and sometimes fail and not self destruct is powerful.   I have learned and am learning so much and I credit Feast with raising the bar for myself. </p>
<p>I feel much more at peace with myself than ever before and I often feel like I know a wonderful secret that I didn't know before.  I now have a cushion of compassion to fall back on so when things aren't going quite my way I have so many more directions to turn than the old habits and negative self talk I used to subject myself to.  <i>Feast</i> and my journey to <i>Feast</i> opened me up to a new way of thinking that I know has changed the way I relate to the world and to myself forever.   And because I now seek out those that can relate to this new way of thinking, the powerfulness and peace continues to grow. </p>
<p>I don't worry that <i>Feast</i> will leave me or that I will forget what I have learned, it's not possible to go back to the way I was before and I am ever so grateful for that shift.  I'm still not sure where I am going or what exactly I am going to do to feed my hungers but it has been such a thrill to realize I have so many hungers and that there are so many different ways that they can be fed.  I am now surrounded by choices where I once saw only one way.  I can't say enough about how wonderful the program is. </p>

Unlike other programs which usually have central concepts that are presented in ways that make you feel like you have been wrong your entire life -- as if there's some "better" version of yourself lurking if you just stand on your head and balance a glass of fresh kale juice on each elbow -- Rachel accepts you as you are, right where you are and the <i>Feast</i> journey guides you to what is most helpful for you.<br>
You learn to pause and listen - to your hungers, to your psyche, to your inner critic, to your own soul - about not only what you are truly hungry for, but also to the voice that says you're worth it. In a nutshell, Feast presented me with a lamp to light my own issues in a safe space, and then gave me the tools to do the work along with the support to keep going both from Rachel and the group. </p>

I knew that my dysfunctional relationship with food was holding me back from a deeper, more-lived life in work and relationships. But I felt broken, alone, and unsure that I could change. From the first week, Rachel presented and supported a fundamentally different way to exist in the world, one that wasn't just about food, but was about a relationship with ME. During <i>Feast</i>, I saw and felt little things every day that uncovered new truths, and debunked old stories that were lies, and connected with other women in a way that left me feeling hopeful, alive, and less afraid of the future. I'm grateful to have learned so much during <i>Feast</i>, and I am excited to see my life shaped for years to come by what I learned during it. </p>

I was tired of disappointing myself and having things eat away at me that I was not doing anything about. I figured that I have taken many college classes over the years, and this was a similar time and cost commitment that I hoped would have benefits for the personal side of my life. During the course, I became much more aware of my body, what it wants, and how I can address those needs. The surprising thing, though, was that this had a lot more to do with all the hungers in my life, of which food is only a small part. I hadn't expected that, and I feel that I'm going forward with much more awareness of myself, and all of my needs. It's a good feeling.</p>

I have a supportive community of women that I can turn to when I'm struggling that can relate and are experiencing similar challenges - this has been extremely helpful to me.  I am much better at noticing when my inner critical voice is in the drivers seat, and I can respond gently and nudge myself in a more compassionate direction.  I have a toolkit full of strategies that I can choose from when I am struggling, and I am more confident in my ability to make a kind and healthy choice, with what I eat and the actions that I take in other areas of my life.

I held a lot of rigidity around diet, health and eating. Feast really challenged me to open up my perspective and have more self compassion, kindness and most importantly release perfection. I have since realized what a culture of perfection and judgement we have created around food. As a nutrition consultant I have now shifted to a more intuitive eating practice and trusting that others know the foods that are best for them instead of me telling them what to eat. Feast was really ingenious and I would expect nothing less from Rachel.  She has really done the work on herself and has brought all of her tools and amazing wisdom here for us to do the work on ourselves and transform unloving behaviors into ones of love and kindness. As she says, the world will be a better place with more well-fed woman. I like to think I can now contribute to that since I have gone through Feast. </p>

                  <p>Online learning isn’t necessarily harder than in-person learning, but it is different. A huge benefit of the virtual nature of <i>Feast</i> is that you and I don’t have to live in the same town in order for us to intimately connect and for you to learn. You can also participate in the course from your home, office, or favorite coffee shop. And for the most part, you can also engage in learning during the time of day that works best for you. </p>
<p>I have taught extensively in-person and virtually. One of my gifts is the ability to create intimacy, trust, and community through online learning. If you show up to read, explore, listen, reflect, practice and discuss the material each week you will have no trouble maximizing your learning.</p>
